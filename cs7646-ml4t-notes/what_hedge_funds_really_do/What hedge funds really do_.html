Expenses are covered by an expense ratio fee, a % of assets managed. There are also front-end and back-end fees charged at buy and sell</div><div><br/></div><div>Hedge funds consist of paired stocks, betting for a particular stock to go one way and another, linked stock to go the opposite. They are lightly regulated and you must be "accredited" (rich) to invest. They usually operate in secret and do not often reveal their strategies.</div><div><br/></div><div>4 main strategies of hedge funds</div><ol start="1"><li>Equity - emphasis on stock selection. Many follow the original long/short model</li><li>Arbitrage - seek price relationships between assets fall outside normal variations. </li><li>Momentum/direction - managers have a macro view of the probable direction of prices in a market</li><li>Event driven - trades are based on an event, such as war, supply disruption, or merger (prominence in 1990s)</li></ol><div><br/></div><div>Many hedge funds borrow against their investment. So a 130/30 equity strategy has gone long with 130% of capital (loan of 30%) and shorted 30%.</div><div><br/></div><div>Because hedge funds are tough to find and compare, there are funds of hedge funds. Hedge funds are paid by a hybrid structure: a traditional expense ratio (1-3%) and a return ratio (~20%). </div><div><br/></div><div>Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) - rate that a fund must grow every year to reach a cumulative growth after several years. For an asset to growth 100% in 10 years, it must have an average CAGR of 7.2%</div><div><br/></div><div>Often, hedge funds outperform their benchmark (alpha), but fees and mgmt compensation eat most of the excess return over benchmark. </div><div><br/></div><div>Risk - volatility of a portfolio's returns. Measured by stdev, which is kinda funny, because it counts positive deviations (good) and negative deviations (bad) as equal. Drawdown is another measure, which is the biggest drop / peak. Sharpe ratio is return / risk.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><b><font style="font-size: 18px;">Chapter 7 - Framework for Investing: The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)</font></b><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Merton Miller, Franco Modigliani, William Sharpe Nobel Prize Econ in 1990 for CAPM</div><div><br/></div><div>CAPM + EMH (Efficient Markets Hypothesis) = very few investors can produce sustained returns superior to market averages. Therefore, buying the market (i.e., an index like S&amp;P500) will be superior to most other strategies. Hedge funds are based on the belief that it is possible to outperform a long-only market strategy.</div><div><br/></div><div>Core of CAPM - distinguishing between stock returns that derive from broad market movements and those intrinsic to the stock.</div><div><br/></div><div>Combining assets with negative correlation in a portfolio reduces that portfolio’s risk</div><div><br/></div><div>Scatterplot daily returns of stock (Y) vs index (X) and fit regression line. </div><div>- Alpha - systematic difference in performance of a stock over and above the market</div><div><br/></div></body></html>
